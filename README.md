# So, What is this?
Nothing much. 
Was bored (and a bit in anxiety from not coding anything in particular) so I opened VS2019, included SDL2 and started coding. 

Features:
- Texture Load
- Tileset Animations
- Game Class
- GameObject class
- Update Manager
- Draw Manager
- DeltaTime and timing in general
- GFX Manager


Next steps:
- Input Manager 
- Basic physics

Will code someday:
- Scene manager
- Sfx manager 
- Something i'm way too tired to acknowledge now.
