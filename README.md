# So, What is this?
Nothing much. 
Was bored (and a bit in anxiety from not coding anything in particular) so I opened VS2019, included SDL2 and started coding. 

Features:
Texture load, tileset animation, Game class

Next steps:
- GameObject class
- GFXManager for faster handling of the pngs
- Update Manager (still needs to be designed, but it is for gameobject that needs update)
- Input Manager 
- Basic physics

Will code someday:
- Scene manager
- Sfx manager 
- Something i'm way too tired to acknowledge now.
